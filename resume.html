<body>
	<p>
	My name is Aidan Toole, and I'm a sophomore at Drexel University, studying Entrepreneurship and Interactive Digital Media. I grew up in Northern Virginia, with my parents and my three younger brothers.
	</p>

	<p>
	I started designing as a freshman in high school, learning the basic principles of Photoshop. Sophomore year I was introduced to Illustrator, Junior year I learned a little bit of 3D modelling with Maya, and I also started doing freelance. By Senior year, I had worked with several clients, and received an award from Scholastic for my work in AP Computer Graphics.
	</p>

	<p>
	A week into freshman year at Drexel, I joined a startup called StudyTree, the &quot;Uber for tutors&quot;, and I performed basic design tasks concerning branding and advertisement. I was also introduced to Sketch and web design. At this point I decided I wanted to learn more about user interfaces. In February, I joined a research organization called Empathic Design &amp; Technology, starting with more branding and visuals but eventually I started designing interfaces. In May, I joined another startup called Tern Water. I spent my summer working for Empathic Design &amp; Technology, designing an interface for TreatYourSelf, a reminder app for youth living with HIV.
	</p>

	<p>
	Today, I am back in classes for the fall and winter quarters, while simulataneously working part time and performing research. I am currently looking for open co-op positions for the Spring and Summer terms.
	</p>

	When I'm not working, I enjoy reading comic books, playing video games, watching crappy movies, and hanging with my friends.
