	Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
	Oh yeah
	And they're gone so fast, yeah
	Oh
	So hold on the ones who really care
	In the end they'll be the only ones there
	And when you get old and start losing your hair
	Can you tell me who will still care
	Can you tell me who will still care?
	Oh care
