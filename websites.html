		<li>I really like this website because everything just blends together. The background and the buttons and the images all come together and transform. Specifically, the square in the center jumps in front and behind a shape or image, like a crocodile or a sneaker.</li>

		<li>I enjoy how the type and content scroll over the background without the background itself moving. I also like the hamburger menu on this website, the options are very direct and in your face, while being simple and clean. The black and white is nice too.</li>

		<li>That can in the middle, while not quite relevant, is really entertaining to watch spin while you scroll, as well as the various animations happening simultaneously. Another primarily black website, it really works. I realy like their style</li>
